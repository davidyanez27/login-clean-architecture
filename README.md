# Login Project Using Clean Architecture

This project demonstrates a simple login system implemented using the principles of Clean Architecture. It aims to separate concerns across different layers, making the system more maintainable, testable, and scalable.

## Introduction

The login project provides a template for implementing a user authentication system using the Clean Architecture approach. The main goals are to:

- Keep the business logic independent of frameworks and UI.
- Enable easier testing of the core application logic.
- Allow independent development of UI and business logic.

## Architecture Overview

Clean Architecture divides the project into several layers:

1. **Entities**: Business objects that encapsulate critical business rules.
2. **Use Cases**: Application-specific business rules.
3. **Interface Adapters**: Converters and adapters to enable communication between the use cases and external agencies like UI and databases.
4. **Frameworks and Drivers**: External agents like databases, UI, web frameworks, etc.

### Layers and Their Responsibilities

- **Entities**: Represent the core business logic and rules.
- **Use Cases**: Coordinate the flow of data to and from entities.
- **Interface Adapters**: Transform data from the format most convenient for use cases and entities to the format most convenient for frameworks and drivers.
- **Frameworks and Drivers**: Interact with external systems like databases and web servers.
